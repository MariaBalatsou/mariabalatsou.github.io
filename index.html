            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Maria Balatsou is a Greek-born writer now happily settled in London. Having been a law student in the City, she moulded early on with the bold and the beautiful—London is home to which has served as a constant inspiration.</p>
            
            <p>Her journey as a writer began at the tender age of six when she first discovered the magic of letters and spelling and even attempted baby poems. Since then, she has embraced any walk of life that plays with words, and when she is not lawyering nor bringing characters from her mind to life, she blogs at <a href="https://jetunsetter.com/blog/" class="book-link">jetunsetter.com</a>.</p>

                <h3>Coming of Age</h3>
                <p><strong>Read on Goodreads:</strong> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/238448242-coming-of-age" class="book-link">Coming of Age</a></p>
                
                <h4 style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;">About the Book</h4>
                <p>It's her 39th birthday. She has it all. The man, the job, the flat. She sees the cracks on her skin. She refuses to see all her other cracks. Her inner voice, louder than ever and bewildered, makes fun of her, trying to speak reason over the impulsive life she is leading.</p>
                
                <p>How will she survive the end of youth? When will she find the courage to face her boss? What could be waiting for her on the other side of a midlife crisis?</p>
                
                <p>You are invited to two of her birthday parties, a decade apart, and the coming of age journey in between.</p>
